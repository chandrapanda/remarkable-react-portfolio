# Remarkable React Portfolio

[Deployed Application](https://chandrapanda.github.io/remarkable-react-portfolio/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

This portfolio showcases my knowledge of React JS!

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
